# memoryDialogueBot
Master Thesis Project

02/04/2020 - The project is developed to be run using the flask library.
Use the following command to set the flask app 'set FLASK_APP = "dialoguebot"'
The project does not currently support threading, so run flask with the following command 'flask run --without-threading'
The main python files are 'agent.py' and 'runAgent.py'. If you wish to run the chatbot without flask then you may wish to run a modified version of 'runAgent.py'

The latest trained GPT-2 generative model can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EeoeK24eIYl44kl3By6KsK8lgcn19qn9

The "memoryDialogueBot" notebook contains interactive demo of chatbot agent with likes/dislikes memory for a limited domain, a GPT-2 Generative model, and a retrieval based model.
